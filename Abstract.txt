Water is an essential element of life and only 3% of fresh water is available on Earth out of which only 1% is drinkable, the other is in the form of glaciers,icebergs etc. Most people depend on Tap water, wells and rivers for daily usage, but today around 70% of sewage in India is discharged into. rivers, which contaminate groundwater,Sometime water pipeline to our home gets broken and sewage water gets merged into it and untreated waste is directly dumped into water bodies which cause pollution, and by drinking that water around 1 out of 5 people suffer from disease. People use Alum to purify water but some microbes are still present. People also can't afford a water purifier at every home as it has a huge installation cost and maintenance. People use to call local water vendors to meet their water need, which also Sometime do not provide purity assurance, on time delivery, Scheduling and trackability, So with growing digital india,we are designing a application for local water vendor which allow their user to order digitally and provide safety checks to assure purity, overcome all mentioned problem and provide ease of life.
